# PH-M04-WO-001 Acceptance checklist

Status: CANDIDATE / NOT ADMITTED
Baseline: main@85489b2d5f7745e9e4dd81495cda41dcaba1090e
Work Order: .engineering/proposals/PH-GOV-WAVE-A-G1-G2/work-orders/PH-M04-WO-001.md

## Admission and integrity

- [ ] G1/G2 governance acceptance is recorded; a fresh Context Lock names the accepted main SHA.
- [ ] All source and contract fingerprints match; no checkpoint/ADR/module/scope drift exists.
- [ ] The issue remains the same existing NECESSARY module; no new module or reclassification was introduced.
- [ ] Upstream STOP/dependency and current VEX/security gates are resolved for this lane.
- [ ] Agent uses one isolated module worktree; changed paths stay inside the exclusive ownership set.
- [ ] liveTradingAuthorized remains false; no secrets, signing, authenticated mutation, VEX transfer or historical storage mutation.

## Implementation and deterministic acceptance

- [ ] AC-01: Same immutable context yields same proposals without clock, network, random, DB or LLM calls.
- [ ] AC-02: Unknown/incomplete/stale required market or fee inputs produce no actionable proposal.
- [ ] AC-03: Outputs cannot submit, sign, cancel or authorize orders.
- [ ] AC-04: Tests cover both strategy IDs, determinism, invalid input, expiry and exact decimal handling.
- [ ] AC-05: No guaranteed-profit or future-return claim.

- [ ] Focused command passes and raw/sanitized receipt is retained.
- [ ] Affected lint, format, typecheck and build checks pass.
- [ ] Exact-head GitHub CI passes on the audited SHA.
- [ ] Required security/dependency scans are current for changed inputs; no unresolved applicable HIGH/CRITICAL finding.
- [ ] Independent reviewer records an exact-head verdict; HIGH_ASSURANCE requirements are satisfied.
- [ ] Evidence Bundle includes path manifest, evidence hashes, assumptions, limitations and rollback.
- [ ] Checkpoint delta remains proposal-only; canonical checkpoint is not modified.

## Lane gate

- [ ] Candidate only; G1/G2 acceptance, fresh lock and upstream stop reconciliation required.
- [ ] No worker wiring or risk integration; coordinator owns shared barrels and integration.
